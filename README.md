### Rules

COURSE RULES on how to get 100 itpu-points:
1. I have 100 itpu-points to share with each of you during semester.
2. We have 30 workshops.
3. During each workshop you can get 3.3 itpu-points in accordance with the quiz results (quiz happens during each workshop).
4. Every quiz would contain 10 questions which in a success run may bring you from 5000 to 10 000 menti-points (depends on how fast you answer).
5. Quiz results would be converted to itpu-points according to the following rules:
```
   menti-points = itpu-points

   [4000, 10000] = 3.3

   [3000, 3999] = 3
   
   [2000, 2999] = 2

   [1000, 1999] = 1
   
   [0, 999] = 0
   ```
   PS. For the previous 3 workshops I am giving you 3.3, 3.3, 4.3 itpu-points accordingly due to your active work and since the rules were set recently.
   PSPS. I hope this challenge would motivate you to look through the learning materials on time.
   PSPSPS. If you have even more interesting idea about how to issue those points - I will consider your proposals.
